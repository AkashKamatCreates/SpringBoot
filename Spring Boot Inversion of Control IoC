- it is the approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects. 
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** is a design principle where the control of creating and managing objects is transferred from the application code to a framework or container. In the context of Spring Boot, the Spring Framework takes over the responsibility of instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of objects (also called beans).

### **Analogy to Explain IoC**
Imagine you go to a restaurant to have a meal:
1. **Without IoC (Traditional Programming):**
    - You are responsible for cooking the food, fetching the ingredients, setting the table, and cleaning up afterward.
    - Here, you (the application) have full control over every aspect of the process.
2. **With IoC (Using Spring Framework):**
    - You walk into the restaurant, place your order, and the chef prepares the meal. The restaurant staff takes care of setting the table, serving the food, and cleaning up.
    - You are just a customer consuming the service without worrying about how the meal is prepared or served.
    - In this case, the **restaurant acts as the Spring Container**, managing all the dependencies (ingredients, kitchen staff, table setup) and serving your request.
### **How IoC Works in Spring Boot**
1. **Your Code Requests Beans:**
    - Instead of creating objects manually using `new`, you define dependencies as beans in Spring.
    - The Spring Container resolves these dependencies for you and injects them where needed.
2. **Spring Container Manages the Beans:**
    - The Spring Container is responsible for:
        - Instantiating the beans.
        - Injecting their dependencies.
        - Managing their lifecycle (creation, destruction).
3. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    - IoC is often achieved using **Dependency Injection (DI)**.
    - DI is a technique where the container injects required dependencies (objects) into your classes rather than your classes creating them.

### **What is a Spring Container?**

The **Spring Container** is the core of the Spring Framework, responsible for implementing IoC. It is a component that:
1. **Creates Beans:** Reads your application configuration (via annotations, XML, or Java-based configurations) and creates the necessary objects (beans).
2. **Manages Beans:** Maintains the lifecycle of beans, including initialization and destruction.
3. **Injects Dependencies:** Supplies the required dependencies into beans, typically through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.
In Spring, a **bean** is essentially an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. It represents a key concept of the Spring Framework and forms the backbone of any Spring application.

### **What is a Bean?**

1. **Java Object:**
    - At its core, a Spring bean is just a regular Java object, a.k.a. a Plain Old Java Object (POJO).
    - However, what makes it special is that it is instantiated, managed, and wired by the Spring container.
2. **Lifecycle Management:**
    - The Spring container controls the lifecycle of a bean (creation, initialization, use, and destruction).
3. **Configuration:**
    - Beans are created based on configuration, which can be provided in:
        - XML files
        - Java-based configuration using annotations (`@Bean`, `@Component`, etc.)
        - Properties or YAML files
